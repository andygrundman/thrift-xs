=head1 NAME

Thrift::XS - Faster Thrift binary protocol encoding and decoding

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Thrift;
    use Thrift::Socket;
    use Thrift::FramedTransport;
    use Thrift::XS::BinaryProtocol;
    use MyThriftInterface;
    
    my $socket    = Thrift::Socket->new( $host, $port );
    my $transport = Thrift::FramedTransport->new($socket);
    my $protocol  = Thrift::XS::BinaryProtocol->new($transport);
    my $client    = MyThriftInterface->new($protocol);
    
    $transport->open;
    
    $client->api_call( @args );
    
=head1 DESCRIPTION

Thrift::XS provides faster versions of Thrift::BinaryProtocol and
Thrift::MemoryBuffer.

Thrift compact protocol support is also available, just replace
Thrift::XS::BinaryProtocol with Thrift::XS::CompactProtocol.

To use, simply replace your Thrift initialization code with the appropriate
Thrift::XS version.

=head1 SPEED

For the best performance, you need to use a custom socket layer and both
L<Thrift::XS::MemoryBuffer> and one of L<Thrift::XS::BinaryProtocol> or
L<Thrift::XS::CompactProtocol>. If using the standard BufferedTransport,
FramedTransport, or HttpClient modules, performance will not be as good
as it could be. In particular, HttpClient is incredibly bad, making a lot of
very small (1-4 byte) sysread() and print() calls. A future version of this
module will probably provide XS implementations of these other modules to
help with this problem.

Here is a breakdown of the performance improvements of the various low-level
methods. A given Thrift API call will make many write and read method calls,
so your results will be some average of these numbers. For detailed numbers
and to run your own benchmarks, see the bench/bench.pl script.

    XS::MemoryBuffer write + read: 6x faster
    
    XS::BinaryProtocol
        writeMessageBegin + readMessageBegin: 12.0x
        complex struct/field write+read:       6.6x
        writeMapBegin + readMapBegin:         24.0x
        writeListBegin + readListBegin:       20.0x
        writeSetBegin + readSetBegin:         21.0x
        writeBool + readBool:                 13.5x
        writeByte + readByte:                 13.9x
        writeI16 + readI16:                   14.4x
        writeI32 + readI32:                   12.9x
        writeI64 + readI64:                   29.4x
        writeDouble + readDouble:             13.5x
        writeString + readString:              7.5x
        
    XS::CompactProtocol
        writeMessageBegin + readMessageBegin: 11.6x
        complex struct/field write+read:       6.2x
        writeMapBegin + readMapBegin:         18.7x
        writeListBegin + readListBegin:       14.1x
        writeSetBegin + readSetBegin:         13.3x
        writeBool + readBool:                 13.2x
        writeByte + readByte:                 13.9x
        writeI16 + readI16:                    9.0x
        writeI32 + readI32:                    7.5x
        writeI64 + readI64:                   10.0x
        writeDouble + readDouble:             13.5x
        writeString + readString:              7.4x
