NAME
    Thrift::XS - Faster Thrift binary protocol encoding and decoding

SYNOPSIS
        use Thrift;
        use Thrift::Socket;
        use Thrift::FramedTransport;
        use Thrift::XS::BinaryProtocol;
        use MyThriftInterface;
    
        my $socket    = Thrift::Socket->new( $host, $port );
        my $transport = Thrift::FramedTransport->new($socket);
        my $protocol  = Thrift::XS::BinaryProtocol->new($transport);
        my $client    = MyThriftInterface->new($protocol);
    
        $transport->open;
    
        $client->api_call( @args );

DESCRIPTION
    Thrift::XS provides faster versions of Thrift::BinaryProtocol and
    Thrift::MemoryBuffer. On average it is about 4-6 times faster.

    To use, simply replace your Thrift initialization code with the
    appropriate Thrift::XS version.
